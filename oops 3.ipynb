    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes two arguments: the file path and the mode in which you want to open the file. There are several modes available for file opening:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r': Read mode. Opens the file for reading (default mode). Raises an error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "'w': Write mode. Opens the file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist, or truncates the existing content if it does.\n",
    "'a': Append mode. Opens the file for writing, but appends new content to the end of the file instead of overwriting.\n",
    "'b': Binary mode. Opens the file in binary mode for reading or writing (e.g., 'rb' or 'wb').\n",
    "'x': Exclusive creation mode. Creates a new file but raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "'t': Text mode. Opens the file in text mode (default).\n",
    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function is used to close an open file. It's important to close a file after you're done working with it to free up system resources and ensure that any buffered data is written to the file. Failing to close a file can lead to resource leaks and unexpected behavior. While some systems may automatically close files when a program ends, it's a good practice to explicitly close them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Write a python program to create a text file. Write ‘I want to become a Data Scientist’ in that file. Then close the file. Open this file and read the content of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Create and write to the file\n",
    "with open('data.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('I want to become a Data Scientist')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open and read the file\n",
    "with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "Q4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline(), and readlines().\n",
    "\n",
    "read(): Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "readline(): Reads a single line from the file. Subsequent calls read subsequent lines.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    line1 = file.readline()\n",
    "    line2 = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(line1)\n",
    "    print(line2)\n",
    "readlines(): Reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "    for line in lines:\n",
    "        print(line)\n",
    "Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and open() together?\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement is used with the open() function to provide better management of resources (like files) by ensuring that the file is properly closed when you're done working with it. The advantage of using with and open() together is that it automatically takes care of closing the file when the block of code inside the with statement is exited, either normally or due to an exception. This helps prevent resource leaks and makes the code more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the write() and writelines() functions. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "write(): Writes a string to the file.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, world!\\n')\n",
    "    file.write('This is a test.\\n')\n",
    "writelines(): Writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "lines = ['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n', 'Line 3\\n']\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "In both cases, the specified content is written to the file. In the second example using writelines(), the list of lines is written sequentially to the file."
